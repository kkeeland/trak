# CJC-1295 DAC — Full Research Profile

## Summary
CJC-1295 DAC is a synthetic 30-amino-acid analog of growth hormone–releasing hormone (GHRH) conjugated to a Drug Affinity Complex (DAC) that binds to serum albumin, extending its half-life from minutes to 6–8 days. Developed by ConjuChem Biotechnologies (Canada) in the early 2000s, it stimulates pituitary somatotroph cells to release growth hormone (GH) and elevate insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) in a dose-dependent manner. It reached Phase II clinical trials but was never FDA-approved.

## Chemistry & Structure

- **Base peptide:** Modified hGRF(1-29) — a tetrasubstituted analog of the first 29 amino acids of human GHRH
- **Amino acid substitutions (4 total):**
  - Position 2: D-Ala (replaces Ala) — confers resistance to DPP-IV cleavage
  - Position 8: Gln (replaces Asn) — prevents asparagine deamidation
  - Position 15: Ala (replaces Gly) — improves stability
  - Position 27: Leu (replaces Met) — prevents methionine oxidation
- **DAC conjugate:** C-terminal Lys residue bearing Nε-3-maleimidopropionamide; this reactive group covalently binds to Cys34 (free thiol) on circulating serum albumin after injection
- **Molecular formula:** C152H252N44O42 (base peptide without DAC)
- **Molecular weight:** ~3,647.95 g/mol (without DAC); higher with DAC-MPA linker
- **Sequence:** Tyr-D-Ala-Asp-Ala-Ile-Phe-Thr-Gln-Ser-Tyr-Arg-Lys-Val-Leu-Ala-Gln-Leu-Ser-Ala-Arg-Lys-Leu-Leu-Gln-Asp-Ile-Leu-Ser-Arg-Lys(MPA-DAC)

## Mechanism of Action

1. **GHRH receptor agonism:** Binds GHRH receptors on anterior pituitary somatotroph cells → activates adenylyl cyclase → cAMP/PKA signaling → GH gene transcription and vesicular GH release
2. **Albumin bioconjugation:** After subcutaneous injection, the maleimide group on DAC covalently binds to Cys34 on serum albumin. The albumin-bound complex is protected from enzymatic degradation and renal clearance, extending half-life from ~7 minutes (native GHRH) to 6-8 days
3. **DPP-IV resistance:** The D-Ala substitution at position 2 prevents dipeptidyl peptidase-IV from cleaving the N-terminal dipeptide, a major degradation pathway for native GHRH
4. **Downstream effects:** Elevated GH stimulates hepatic IGF-1 production → IGF-1 mediates anabolic effects via JAK/STAT and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways
5. **Pulsatility preservation:** Despite continuous circulating presence, natural GH pulse frequency and amplitude are maintained; trough (basal) GH is elevated, which drives IGF-1 increase

|---------|----------|-------------|
| Half-life | 6–8 days | ~30 minutes |
| Injection frequency | 1–2x/week | 2–3x/daily |
| GH release pattern | Sustained trough elevation | Pulsatile bursts |
| Albumin binding | Covalent (Cys34) | None |
| IGF-1 elevation | Prolonged (9–11 days per dose) | Transient (hours) |
| Receptor desensitization risk | Possible with extended use | Lower (intermittent stimulation) |

## Safety & Side Effects

### From clinical trials (Teichman 2006):
- No serious adverse reactions at 30–60 µg/kg
- "Safe and relatively well tolerated"

### Commonly reported:
- Injection site reactions (redness, swelling)
- Transient flushing/warmth
- Water retention
- Headache
- Tingling/numbness in extremities
- Flu-like symptoms (rare)

### Important notes:
- Does NOT increase cortisol, prolactin, or appetite (unlike GHRPs)
- Contraindicated in active cancer (GH may accelerate tumor growth)
- Not FDA-approved; available only as research chemical
- ConjuChem development ceased before Phase III trials

## Common Research Stacks

1. **CJC-1295 DAC + Ipamorelin** — Most popular combination. CJC-1295 amplifies the GHRH signal while Ipamorelin triggers GH pulses via the ghrelin/GHS receptor. Different receptor pathways → synergistic effect.
2. **CJC-1295 DAC + GHRP-6** — Stronger GH release but GHRP-6 increases appetite and cortisol.
3. **CJC-1295 DAC + BPC-157** — Recovery-focused stack; BPC-157 for tissue healing, CJC-1295 for systemic GH/IGF-1 support.

## Regulatory Status

- **USA:** Not FDA-approved. Available as research chemical. FDA included CJC-1295 in peptide regulatory review (2024 docket FDA-2024-N-4777).
- **Canada:** Developed by ConjuChem (Montreal); no marketing authorization.
- **WADA:** Prohibited in sport (S2 category — Peptide Hormones, Growth Factors).
- **General:** Classified as investigational; no country has approved it for clinical use.

## Developer History

- **ConjuChem Biotechnologies** (Montreal, Canada) developed CJC-1295 using their proprietary DAC bioconjugation platform
- Early 2000s: Preclinical development and Phase I/II clinical trials
- The DAC technology was the key innovation — allowing single-injection weekly dosing
- Regulatory challenges and commercial difficulties halted further clinical development
- The compound transitioned to the research/peptide community where it remains widely studied
