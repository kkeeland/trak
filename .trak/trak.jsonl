Background: scrape site, extract brand voice, products, social links.\n3.

'Give them something to do' — pre-populated task suggestions based on scrape: 'Draft 5 Instagram posts', 'Write competitor analysis', 'Review website copy'. One tap. (15s)\n5.

QUICK INTERVIEW (chat-style, not a form) — 3-4 rapid questions:\n   - 'What do you do?' (free text: 'I sell handmade candles on Etsy')\n   - 'Who are your customers?' (free text or pick: 'Direct consumers / Other businesses / Both')\n   - 'What's your biggest headache right now?'
